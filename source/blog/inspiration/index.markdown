  > So, you press the button on the forehead of the first person and the person says, "Julian McNeil." Ok good. Then you press the button on the forehead of the second person and the person says, "Sally Reynolds." Good again. When you get to the 3rd person, there is no person. Just a button on the floor that says full name. You press the button anyways. Nothing. How can that person say their full name if there is no person? That 3rd person is nil.
