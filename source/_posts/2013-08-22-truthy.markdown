The truth is that noticed that I learn much better watching a tutorial than reading one. But no worries, I will finish the Hartl tutorial (yes, eventually!).

While building a little app in Rails (with users, authentification and stuff) I ran into a few problems with Rails 4 and Devise. The video tutorial was using a previous version of Rails and thus still required adding stuff (first_name, last_name, profile_name) to the Model´s attr_accessible. But THERE IS NO attr_accessible in Rails 4 anymore. So I had to read about what to do instead, strong parameters etc (whoop, whoop). The Devise documentation got me a bit confused so I found [this guide](http://blog.12spokes.com/web-design-development/adding-custom-fields-to-your-devise-user-model-in-rails-4/) to help me make my user whole again.

Also....turbolinks! But that´s a whole nuther thang.
