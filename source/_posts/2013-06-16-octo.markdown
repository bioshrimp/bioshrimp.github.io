The instructions for setting up [Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) sounded super easy. When it came to deploying to GitHub though <code>$ rake setup_github_pages</code> wouldn´t <code>Switch the active branch from master to source</code>. My attempt to set this up manually then fucked up the configurations. Unfortunately I did not succeed to fix it myself but [Matt](https://twitter.com/fidothe) from our [@RubyMonsters](https://twitter.com/RubyMonsters) study group helped out and we got it working in the end. I am thrilled when I can find the answers searching on the internet but often, especially as a learner, I just fail to recognize possible solutions which can be extremely frustrating. So it's absolutely amazing to have people around whom I can ask directly as well. I think I would given up long ago if it were just me and a search engine.
