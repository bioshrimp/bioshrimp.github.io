It was great to attend the [CSSconfeu](http://2013.cssconf.eu/). Thanks to [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) and cssconfeu organizers for offering me a free ticket. Wheeee. Some talks
were too advanced for me to understand (e.g. "Mind-blowing Power of Sass 3.3." by Chris Eppstein) but the intro by Jed Schmidt, Nicole Sullivan, Razvan Caliman (CSS shapes & regions) and Rachel Nabors (animation) were really
enjoyable, also for a beginner. 

Edit: Here is the wonderful and funny intro by Jed:
