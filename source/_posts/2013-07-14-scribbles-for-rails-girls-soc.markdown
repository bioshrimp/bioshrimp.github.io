Programming progress is currently not happening. I am still havenÂ´t passed chapter 5 of the [Michael Hartl Rails tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=4.0#sec-install_rails). But there are other things: 
I was kindly asked if I would like to do some drawings for [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) website, an organisation which is helping students to work on open source projects for a few month. A really supreme cool thing and if I hadn't a full time job I would have loved to apply myself.
